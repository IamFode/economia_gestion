abstract="Wavelets provide a flexible basis for representing a signal that can be regarded as a generalization of Fourier analysis to non-stationary processes, or as a filter bank that can represent complex functions that might include abrupt changes in functional form, or signals with time varying frequency and amplitude. Of greatest import for economic analysis is the orthogonal deconstruction of a signal into time scale components that allow economic relationships to be analysed time scale by time scale and then re-synthesized.",

abstract = {Central banks have different objectives in the short and long run. Governments operate simultaneously at different timescales. Many economic processes are the result of the actions of several agents, who have different term objectives. Therefore, a macroeconomic time series is a combination of components operating on different frequencies. Several questions about economic time series are connected to the understanding of the behavior of key variables at different frequencies over time, but this type of information is difficult to uncover using pure time-domain or pure frequency-domain methods. To our knowledge, for the first time in an economic setup, we use cross-wavelet tools to show that the relation between monetary policy variables and macroeconomic variables has changed and evolved with time. These changes are not homogeneous across the different frequencies.}

abstract = {This paper provides a fresh new insight into the dynamic relationship between money growth and inflation in China by applying a novel wavelet analysis. From a time-domain view, our findings show strong but not homogenous links between money growth and inflation in the mid-1990s and the period since the early 2000s. Especially since the early 2000s, China's monetary policy has achieved much better performance in terms of inflation management compared to previous years. From a frequency-domain view, we find that money growth and inflation are positively related in one-to-one fashion in the medium or long run whereas they deviates from such a positive relation in the short run due to temporary shocks and significant lag effects. We can also conclude for China that the long-run relationship between M0 growth and inflation supports the modern quantity theory of money (QTM), while the medium-run relationship between M1 growth and inflation as well as M2 growth and inflation supports the modern QTM. In general, however, our results fit well with the fact that China has experienced economic transitions and structural adjustments in monetary policy over the past two decades. Based on the above analysis, this paper provides an overall view of monetary policy operations and some beneficial implications for China.}

  abstract={Correlations of inflation with the growth rate of money increase when data are averaged over longer time periods. Correlations of inflation with the growth of money also are higher when high-inflation as well as low-inflation countries are included in the analysis. We show that serial correlation in the underlying inflation rate ties these two observations together and explains them. We present evidence that averaging increases the correlation of inflation and money growth more when the underlying inflation rate has higher serial correlation.},
