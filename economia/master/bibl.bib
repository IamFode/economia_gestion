 abstract = {This paper models and estimates the volatility of nonfinancial, innovative and hi-tech focused stock index, the Nasdaq-100, using univariate asymmetric GARCH models. We employ EGARCH and GJR-GARCH using daily data over the period January 4, 2000 through March 19, 2019. We find that the volatility shocks on the index returns are quite persistent. Furthermore, our findings show that the index has leverage effect, and the impact of shocks is asymmetric, whereby the impacts of negative shocks on volatility are higher than those of positive shocks of the same magnitude. The financial implication of the findings for investors is that Nasdaq-100 index returns’ volatility exhibits clustering, and this permits investors to establish future positions in expectation of this characteristic.}

simplicial complex is simply the standard homology of a particular graded module over a polynomial ring.
Our analysis establishes the existence of a simple description of
persistent homology groups over arbitrary fields.
It also enables us to derive a natural
algorithm for computing persistent homology of spaces in arbitrary dimension over any field.
This result generalizes and extends the previously known
algorithm that was restricted to subcomplexes of S3 and
Z2 coefficients.
Finally, our study implies the lack of a simple classification over non-fields.
Instead, we give an algorithm for computing individual
persistent homology groups over an arbitrary principal ideal domain in any dimension.},

abstract = "Background: Scientists are beginning to document abnormalities in white matter connectivity in major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent developments in diffusion-weighted image analyses, including tractography clustering methods, may yield improved characterization of these white matter abnormalities in MDD. In this study, we acquired diffusion-weighted imaging data from MDD participants and matched healthy controls. We analyzed these data using two tractography clustering methods: automated fiber quantification (AFQ) and the maximum density path (MDP) procedure. We used AFQ to compare fractional anisotropy (FA; an index of water diffusion) in these two groups across major white matter tracts. Subsequently, we used the MDP procedure to compare FA differences in fiber paths related to the abnormalities in major fiber tracts that were identified using AFQ.Results: FA was higher in the bilateral corticospinal tracts (CSTs) in MDD (p's < 0.002). Secondary analyses using the MDP procedure detected primarily increases in FA in the CST-related fiber paths of the bilateral posterior limbs of the internal capsule, right superior corona radiata, and the left external capsule.Conclusions: This is the first study to implicate the CST and several related fiber pathways in MDD. These findings suggest important new hypotheses regarding the role of CST abnormalities in MDD, including in relation to explicating CST-related abnormalities to depressive symptoms and RDoC domains and constructs.",

abstract = {We explore the evolution of daily returns of four major US stock market indices during the technology crash of 2000, and the financial crisis of 2007–2009. Our methodology is based on topological data analysis (TDA). We use persistence homology to detect and quantify topological patterns that appear in multidimensional time series. Using a sliding window, we extract time-dependent point cloud data sets, to which we associate a topological space. We detect transient loops that appear in this space, and we measure their persistence. This is encoded in real-valued functions referred to as a ’persistence landscapes’. We quantify the temporal changes in persistence landscapes via their Lp-norms. We test this procedure on multidimensional time series generated by various non-linear and non-equilibrium models. We find that, in the vicinity of financial meltdowns, the Lp-norms exhibit strong growth prior to the primary peak, which ascends during a crash. Remarkably, the average spectral density at low frequencies of the time series of Lp-norms of the persistence landscapes demonstrates a strong rising trend for 250 trading days prior to either dotcom crash on 03/10/2000, or to the Lehman bankruptcy on 09/15/2008. Our study suggests that TDA provides a new type of econometric analysis, which complements the standard statistical measures. The method can be used to detect early warning signals of imminent market crashes. We believe that this approach can be used beyond the analysis of financial time series presented here.}

abstract = {This article explores the applications of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) in the finance field, especially addressing the primordial problem of asset allocation. Firstly, we build a rationale on why TDA can be a better alternative to traditional risk indicators such as standard deviation using real data sets. We apply Takens embedding theorem to reconstruct the time series of returns in a high dimensional space. We adopt the sliding window approach to draw the time-dependent point cloud data sets and associate a topological space with them. We then apply the persistent homology to discover the topological patterns that appear in the multidimensional time series. The temporal changes in the persistence landscapes, which are the real-valued functions that encode the persistence of topological patterns, are captured via Lp norm. The time series of the Lp norms shows that it is better at measuring the dynamics of returns than the standard deviation. Inspired by our findings, we explore an application of TDA in Enhanced Indexing (EI) that aims to build a portfolio of fewer assets than that in the index to outperform the latter. We propose a two-step procedure to accomplish this task. In step one, we utilize the Lp norms of the assets to propose a filtration technique of selecting a few assets from a larger pool of assets. In step two, we propose an optimization model to construct an optimal portfolio from the class of filtered assets for EI. To test the efficiency of this enhanced algorithm, experiments are carried out on ten data sets from financial markets across the globe. Our extensive empirical analysis exhibits that the proposed strategy delivers superior performance on several measures, including excess mean returns from the benchmark index and tail reward-risk ratios than some of the existing models of EI in the literature. The proposed filtering strategy is also noted to be beneficial for both risk-seeking and risk-averse investors.}

We build an early warning system to detect the critical dates on the financial time series. By constructing complexes on the point clouds data with sliding windows, we explore their topological changes from window to window. The persistence barcodes, diagrams and landscapes are obtained from the complexes of several US’s stock indices. We detect the early warning signal of the 2008 crisis in the first half of 2007. The changes of complexes are also shown in detail. And then we choose several European countries’ typical indices to do a similar work. The topological structures of the complexes change sharply in 2008 and 2010. It shows us clearly that 2008 and 2010 financial crises affected European stock markets greatly. To study the condition of China’s stock markets during the crises, we choose two major stock indices to construct complexes and analyze their changes. The early warning signal is also detected in the early 2007, and China’s stock markets experienced quite a long period of intense turbulence around 2008. However, it was not so serious as US’s and European markets. Furthermore, we also see that European debt crisis did not obviously affect China’s stock markets.}

Thus, existing data analysis methods, represented by Time Series Analysis and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), have emerged at this point of time to explore customer relationships. Based on the latest research of time series analysis and TDA, application of analysis is explored in practice. The relationship between topology and datasets will be given by displaying the process of TDA. In the end, there will be a discussion about the efficiency of different approaches, the improvement of tools in this paper and their extended application. This work is intended to provide a brief introduction of TDA and other methods to help readers understand concepts easily and provide suggestions for future studies.}
